				<span>I am the centre</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a circle of pain</span>

				<span>Exceeding its boundaries in every direction</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The business of the bland sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has no affair with me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my congested cosmos of agony</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which there is no escape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On infinitely prolonged nerve-vibrations</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or in contraction</span>

				<span>To the pin-point nucleus of being</span>

				<span>It is<span> </span>within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is without.</span>

				<span>The sensitized area</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is identical with the extensity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of intension</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I am the false quantity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the harmony of physiological potentiality</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To which</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaining self-control</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should be consonant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In time</span>

				<span>Pain is no stronger than the resisting force</span>

				<span>Pain calls up in me</span>

				<span>The struggle is equal</span>

			<p>
				<span>The open window is full of a voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fashionable portrait-painter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Running up-stairs to a woman’s apartment</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings</span>

				<span class="i1">“All the girls are tid’ly did’ly</span>

			<p>
				<span>I am climbing a distorted mountain of agony</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Incidentally with the exhaustion of control</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I reach the summit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gradually subside into anticipation of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Repose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which never comes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For another mountain is growing up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which goaded by the unavoidable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must traverse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Traversing myself</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Something in the delirium of night-hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Confuses while intensifying sensibility</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blurring spatial contours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So aiding elusion of the circumscribed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the gurgling of a crucified wild beast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comes from so far away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the foam on the stretched muscles of a mouth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is no part of myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is a climax in sensibility</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When pain surpassing itself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Becomes exotic</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ego succeeds in unifying the positive and negative poles of sensation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uniting the opposing and resisting forces</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In lascivious revelation</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Relaxation</span>

				<span>Negation of myself as a unit</span>

					<span>Though you had never possessed me</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Leaning against your shoulder</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And your careless arm across my back gesticulated</span>

					<span>Through my brain and my body</span>

					<span>Arguing dynamic decomposition</span>

					<span>And the only less male voice of your brother pugilist of the intellect</span>

					<span>Boomed as it seemed to me so sleepy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Across an interval of a thousand miles</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But you who make more noise than any man in the world when you clear your throat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deafening woke me</span>
					<br/>

				<span>Man of absolute physical equilibrium</span>

				<span>Every plank or clod you plant your feet on</span>

				<span>So at the same time</span>

				<br/>
				<span>In the opposite direction</span>

				<span>The threewomen who all walked</span>

				<span>In the same dress</span>

				<span>And it had falling ferns on it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skipped parallel</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Of Giovanni Franchi</span>
			</p>

				<span>Giovanni Franchi’s wrists flicked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flickeringly as he flacked them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His wrists explained things</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Infectiously by way of his adolescence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His adolescence was all there was of him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whatever was left was rather awkward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His adolescence tuned to the tops of trees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descended to the fallacious nobility</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his first pair of trousers</span>

			<p>
				<span>They were tubular flapped friezily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The colour of coppered mustard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What matter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were they not the first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No others could ever be the first again</span>

				<span>Démodé</span>

			<p>
				<span>Allow us to rely on our instincts</span>

			<p>
				<span>The threewomen was composed of three instincts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each sniffing divergently directed draughts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The first instinct first again may</span>
				<br/>
				<span>renascent gods save us from the enigmatic</span>

				<span>penetralia of Firstness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was to be faithful to a man first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The second to be loyal to herself first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She would have to find which self first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The third which might as well have been first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was to find out how many toes the</span>
				<br/>
				<span>philosopher Giovanni Bapini had first</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Giovanni Franchi hooligan-faced and latin-born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You imagine what he looked like</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked it as nearly as he could as the</span>
				<br/>
				<span>philosopher looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His articulations were excellent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still where Giovanni Bapini was symophonous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Giovanni Franchi was merely pale</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His acolytian sincerity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sensitive down among his freckles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell in with the patriotic souls of flags</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red white and green flags fillipping piazzas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the “National Idea” arrived on the Milan Express</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He scuttled winsomely</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To its distribution from a puffer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the declaration of War</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Continually cutting off an angle from Paschkowski’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through plate-glass swingings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To look as busy bodily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the philosopher’s brain was</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Giovanni Bapini importuned mobs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From monumental gums</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the sparky detritus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the hurried cigarette</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his disciple</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whose papa and mama kept a trattoria</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Audaciously squatting right opposite the Pitti Palace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Pitti Palace however stolid could hardly help noticing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being an aristocrat it went on looking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As plainly piled up as ever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Pitti Palace has never been known to mention the trattoria</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or mention Giovanni Franchi</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting in it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At a book</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It could not see from that distance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Giovanni watching the munchers supporting his parents</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With an eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On assuring himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of their sufficient impression</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By erudition</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He was so young</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That explains so much</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No book ever explained what to be young is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But they look so much more important for that</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Giovanni was in continuous exstacy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Induced by the imposing look of them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Giovanni Bapini spoke of them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He could not tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How completely more precious</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would be such knowledge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As how many toes the philosopher Giovanni Bapini had</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the threewomen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For pity’s sake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us think of her as she to save time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing the minor Giovanni</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting at the major Giovanni’s feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made sure he must be counting his toes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All to the contrary he was picking the philosopher’s brains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Happy in the security that when he had done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would still be youthful enough to sort out his own</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He listened at the elder’s lips</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That taught him of earthquakes and women</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of women————————</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His manners were abominable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would kill a woman</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quite inconspicuously it is true</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And neglect to attend her funeral</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I mean the older man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what he told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Giovanni Franchi</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About these pernicious persons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was so extremely good for him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It entirely spoilt his first love-affair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To such an extent it never came off</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We have read of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trattoria meaning eating house.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Piazzas or squares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Pitti Palace enormous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Paschkowski’s for beer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All are in Firenze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Firenze is Florence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some think it is a woman with flowers in her hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But <strong>no</strong> it is a city with stones on the streets</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Giovanni Bapini often said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everybody in Firenze knows me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And everybody did</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Excepting—That is she didn’t</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She never knew what he was</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or how he was himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet she uniquely was the one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To speculate upon the number of his toes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The days growing longer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fulfilling her of curiosity</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She made a moth’s-net</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of metaphor and miracles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the incandescent breath of civilizations</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She chased by moon-and-morn light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Philosopher’s toes</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As virginal as had he never worn them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear of “white marks means money”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All quicks and cores</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fluttered to her fantasy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell into her lap</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While she gathered her ferny flounces about them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They inappropriately passed</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Giovanni Franchi was there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He almost winked it at her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he was there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eyes were intrepid with phantom secrets</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Philosopher had flung to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as she tripped by him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She guessed these all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All but the number of those toes</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She made diurnal pilgrimage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the trattoria</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To eat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trout that might have been trained for circuses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If minarettes grew in miniature whirlpools</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mayonaise that helped her to forget</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That what is underneath need never matter</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She put all minor riddles out of her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What was the under-cover of Franchi’s book</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Telling to the plaid pattern of the table-cloth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too shy to interrogate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She sent ambassadors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the disciple</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh rats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quite manifest that Giovanni Franchi</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some semieffigy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Damned by scholiums</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knew no more how many toes—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than Giovanni Bapini knew himself</span>

				<span>The door was an absurd thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet it was passable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They quotidienly passed through it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was this shape</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gina and Miovanni who they were God knows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They knew it was important to them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This being of who they were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They were themselves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Corporeally transcendentally consecutively</span>
				<br/>
				<span>conjunctively and they were quite complete</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the evening they looked out of their two windows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Miovanni out of his library window</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gina from the kitchen window</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From among his pots and pans</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where he so kindly kept her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where she so wisely busied herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pots and Pans she cooked in them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All sorts of sialagogues</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some say that happy women are immaterial</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So here we might dispense with her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gina being a female</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she was more than that</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being an incipience a correllative</span>
				<br/>
				<span>an instigation of the reaction of man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the palpable to the transcendent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mollescent irritant of his fantasy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gina had her use Being useful</span>
				<br/>
				<span>contentedly conscious</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She flowered in Empyrean</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which no well-mated woman ever returns</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sundays a warm light in the parlor</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the gritty road on the white wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>anybody could see it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shimmered a composite effigy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Madonna crinolined a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>hidden beneath her hoop</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ho for the blue and red of her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The silent eyelids of her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shiny smile of her</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ding dong said the bell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Miovanni Gina called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would it be fitting for you to tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>the time for supper</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pooh said Miovanni I am</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Outside time and space</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Patience said Gina is an attribute</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she learned at any hour to offer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dish appropriately delectable</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What had Miovanni made of his ego</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his library</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What had Gina wondered among the pots and pans</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One never asked the other</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So they the wise ones eat their suppers in peace</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of what their peace consisted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We cannot say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only that he was magnificently man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She insignificantly a woman who understood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Understanding what is that</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Each his entity to others</span>
				<br/>
				<span>their idiosyncrasies to the free expansion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>to the annexed their liberty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To man his work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To woman her love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Succulent meals and an occasional caress</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">So be it</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">It so seldom is</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While Miovanni thought alone in the dark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gina supposed that peeping she might see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A round light shining where his mind was</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She never opened the door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fearing that this might blind her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or even</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she should see Nothing at all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So while he thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She hung out of the window</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watching for falling stars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when a star fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She wished that still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Miovanni would love her to-morrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as Miovanni</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never gave any heed to the matter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He did</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gina was a woman</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who wanted everything</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be everything in woman</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everything everyway at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diurnally varigate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Miovanni always knew her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She was Gina</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gina who lent monogamy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her fluctuant aspirations</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A changeant consistency</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unexpected intangibilities</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Miovanni remained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Monumentally the same</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The same Miovanni</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If he had become anything else</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gina’s world would have been at an end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gina with no axis to revolve on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must have dwindled to a full stop</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the mornings she dropped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cool crystals</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through devotional fingers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saccharine for his cup</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And marketed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a Basket</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trimmed with a red flannel flower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she was lazy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She wrote a poem on the milk bill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The first strophe Good morning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The second Good night</span>
