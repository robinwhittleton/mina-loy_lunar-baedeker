						<span>Her hand to her side pressing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Suffering</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Being bewitched</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cesira fading</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Daily daily feeble softer</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The doctor———“Pthisis”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wise woman says to take her</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So we following her instruction</span>

						<span>I and the neighbour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Take her—</span>

					<p>
						<span>The glass rattling</span>

						<span>The rain slipping</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I and the neighbour and her aunt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bunched together</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Cesira</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Droops across the cab</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Fields and houses</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pass like the pulling out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sweetmeat ribbon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From a rascal’s mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wheel in a rut</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jerks back my girl on the padding</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the hedges into the sky</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Coming to the magic tree</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Cesira becomes as a wild beast</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i3">A tree of age</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“If Cesira should not become as a wild beast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is merely Pthisis”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This being the wise woman’s instruction</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Knowing she has to die</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We drive home</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wait</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She certainly does in time</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It is unnatural in a Father</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bewitching a daughter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose hair down covers her thighs.</span>

						<span>Man of absolute physical equilibrium</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You stand so straight on your legs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Every plank or clod you plant your feet on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Becomes roots for those limbs</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Among the men you accrete to yourself</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You are more heavy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And more light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Force being most equitably disposed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is easiest to lift from the ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So at the same time</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your movements</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unassailable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Savor of the airy-fairy of the ballet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The essence of a Mademoiselle Genée</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Winks in the to-and-fro of your cuff-links</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Your projectile nose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has meddled in the more serious business</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the battle-field</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With the same incautious aloofness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of intense occupation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That it snuffles the trail of the female</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the comfortable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Passing odors of love</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Your genius</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So much less in your brain</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Than in your body</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reinforcing the hitherto negligible</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Qualities</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deals so exclusively with</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The vital</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That it is equally happy expressing itself</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through the activity of pushing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the opposite direction</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To that which they are lethargically willing to go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As in the amative language</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the eyes</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Fundamentally unreliable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You leave others their initial strength</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Concentrating</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On stretching the theoretic elastic of your conceptions</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till the extent is adequate</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Of any—or all</span>

						<span>I am the centre</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of a circle of pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Exceeding its boundaries in every direction</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The business of the bland sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has no affair with me</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In my congested cosmos of agony</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From which there is no escape</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On infinitely prolonged nerve-vibrations</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or in contraction</span>

						<span>Locate an irritation without</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is within</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is without.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sensitized area</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is identical with the extensity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of intension</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I am the false quantity</span>

						<span>In the harmony of physiological potentiality</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To which</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gaining self-control</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I should be consonant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In time</span>

					<p>
						<span>Pain is no stronger than the resisting force</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pain calls up in me</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The struggle is equal</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The open window is full of a voice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A fashionable portrait painter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Running up-stairs to a woman’s apartment</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sings</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">“All the girls are tid’ly did’ly</span>

						<br/>
						<span>The conception Brute</span>

						<span>I am climbing a distorted mountain of agony</span>

						<span>And gradually subside into anticipation of</span>

						<span>Repose</span>

						<span>For another mountain is growing up</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which goaded by the unavoidable</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Traversing myself</span>

					<p>
						<span>Something in the delirium of night-hours</span>

						<span>Blurring spatial contours</span>

						<span>That the gurgling of a crucified wild beast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Comes from so far away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the foam on the stretched muscles of a mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is no part of myself</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is a climax in sensibility</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When pain surpassing itself</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Becomes exotic</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the ego succeeds in unifying the positive and negative poles of sensation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Uniting the opposing and resisting forces</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In lascivious revelation</span>
